`gamedata\textures\ui\cursor.thm`<br/>
<br/>
**English_Voices_Addon_CoC_1.5 - Anomaly Compatible**<br/>
*Based off [English Voices Addon for COC 1.5](https://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-chernobyl/addons/coc-english-voices-addon). Adds English voices from all games EXCEPT those that are present in the Anomaly English Mod. Since all voices have been added some characters might have 2 voices thanks to audio from different games. But such is life in the zone*<br/>

## TODO
- [X] HUD Remove Ammo Count (Port from Last Day)
- [X] HUD Neutral crosshair (like Last Day) so it is only a dot.
- [X] Add in more English Voices.
- [ ] "Lost to the Zone" Message on death (Maybe).
- [ ] Remove Aurora Borealis effect when close to death.
- [ ] Remove all crosshairs (different from disable. Disabling removed NPC identification).
